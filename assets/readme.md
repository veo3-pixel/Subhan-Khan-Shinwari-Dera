# Assets Folder

This folder serves as the central repository for application resources such as images, icons, and static files.

- Store menu item images here.
- Store branding logos here.
- Store other static assets here.

In the current implementation, images uploaded via the POS interface are converted to Base64 data strings for local storage persistence to simulate a file system without a backend server.
